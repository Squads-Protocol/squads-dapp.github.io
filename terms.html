                    <li>If a potential Dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@sqds.io" class="email">info@sqds.io</a> so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution.</li>
                    <li>If we are not able to reach an informal resolution within 60 days of your email, then you and we may bring proceedings either in binding arbitration, if clause 21 applies to you, or in the courts of British Virgin Islands, if clause 21 does not apply to you.</li>

                <b>DISPUTE RESOLITION (US RESIDENTS)</b>
                <p>IF YOU ARE RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“USA”), THIS CLAUSE 21 REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Binding arbitration. Any Dispute shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules (“JAMS Rules”), hereby incorporated by reference and available from JAMS’ website at /www.jamsadr.com/.</li>
                    <li>Federal Arbitration Act. This Agreement affects interstate commerce and the enforceability of this clause 28.4 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. ( “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
                    <li>The Arbitral Process. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator. Only as limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes and shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>Seat. The seat, or place of, of arbitration will be New York. The language to be used in the arbitration proceedings shall be English. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. This clause 28.4 shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of applicable jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>Class Action Waiver. You and we agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and we expressly waive the right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court, arbitrator or arbitral tribunal determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have NOT agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
                    <li>Exception: Litigation of IP and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in any applicable court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>Right to Opt-out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out via email to <a href="mailto:info@sqds.io" class="email">info@sqds.io</a>. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of our Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</li>
                    <li>Changes. We will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this clause.</li>
                    <li>Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</li>
                    <li>Fair Representation. The parties agree that, wherever practicable, they will seek to appoint a fair representation of diverse arbitrators (considering gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation), and will request administering institutions to include a fair representation of diverse candidates on their rosters and list of potential arbitrator appointees.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You and we agree that the Courts of British Virgin Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Dispute that is not subject to arbitration under clause 21 and that any Dispute must be resolved in accordance with BVI law without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and we further agree that any Dispute is personal to you and us and shall be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a representative action, group litigation order or any other type of class or collective action proceeding.</p>
